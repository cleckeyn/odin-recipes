        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>
                This is how I make medium-boiled eggs.
            </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>2 large eggs</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Put water in a small saucepan almost to the top, and bring to a boil.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Carefully put eggs inside the saucepan, and set a timer for 7 minutes.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Once the 7 minutes are up, place the eggs in a bowl of cold water with ice
                    to stop the cooking process.
                </li>
            </ol>
